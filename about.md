title: About this Course
---

This course was originally developed by [Tom Meagher][1] and
[Travis Swicegood][2] for the [NICAR15][] conference.  It's meant to serve as an
introduction to data science tools for journalists who have basic familiarity
with Python and an understanding of spreadsheets, but want to enhance their
skills.
